            <h2>Programmer</h2>
            <p>My name is Prajwal, and I am currently pursuing a BE degree in Information Science Engineering at The National Institute Of Engineering college. Through completing multiple projects and solving DSA problems, I have gained extensive knowledge in programming and its uses in the IT industry. I am now looking for opportunities in the IT sector to gain hands-on experience and apply the theoretical knowledge I have acquired throughout my college years.<br />
                During my studies, I successfully completed my college courses, an NPTEL course titled "Joy of Computing using Python," and solved multiple DSA problems on LeetCode and GeeksForGeeks.<br />
                In my leisure time, I enjoy playing cricket, watching educational videos on YouTube, and reading about the latest developments in technology across various fields. I strongly believe that consistency and growth go hand-in-hand, so I strive to maintain a consistent work ethic.</p>
